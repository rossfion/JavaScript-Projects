The vanilla JavaScript projects in this folder have been completed by following courses from Udemy Instructor Edwin Diaz.

I have taken the opportunity to update the syntax to use ES6, and I have added vendor prefixes in one CSS file.

I have also changed the variables to make them more understandable, at least, to me.

Styling has been added to all projects.

The winter seasonal color palette used in the ToDo List project is from colorhunt.co.

All projects were built and updated using VSCode on a Windows 8 machine.
